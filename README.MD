# A Simple Alarm Clock
This project is meant for me to practice coding with python via creating an 
alarm clock that uses a simple GUI interface. I utilized modules and 
separate class module files to improve my organization and understanding of 
classes. I am presented with the following task: write a function that takes 
an alarm time from a user and plays a random sound once the alarm time is 
reached.


## Running The Project
**NOTE: Your IDE may configure the project implicitly as a module. BE SURE TO 
RUN STEP 4 BELOW BEFORE SUBMITTING LABS** 

1. Download and install Python on your computer
2. Navigate to the [AlarmClock.Mod1]() directory
3. Run the program as a module: `python -m Mod1 -h`. This will print the help 
   message.
4. Run the program as a module (with real inputs): `python -m Mod1`
   a. IE: `python -m Mod1`

The program's output will be displayed in the output.txt file.

### Mod1 Usage:

```commandline
usage: python -m Mod1 [-h] 

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show a help message and exits the program
```

Usage statements are very formalized

| Symbol    | Meaning   |
| ---           | ---       |
| [var]         | variable var is optional. |
| var           | variable var is required. All positional arguments are required.|
| -v, --version | This refers to a flag. One dash + one letter OR two dashes and a whole word. Some flags take one or more arguments |
| +             | This argument consumes 1 or more values |
| *             | This argument consumes 0 or more values |

### Project Layout

The following was my project's package layout:

* AlarmClock.Mod1/: `The parent or "root" folder containing all of the 
  projecs files`
    * README.md:
      `The README files that describes my programs and the nuances needed 
      to run the program`
    * Mod1/: 
      `The module of my program (per requirement).`
      * __init__.py 
        `This python file details critical functions, variables, and 
        classes that are exposed when scripts import the Lab1 module.`
      * __main__.py 
        `The starting point when the program runs, it handles command line 
        arguments.`
      * *.py 
        `Holds the scripts that perform the code.`
